An orientation quaternion describes the orientation of an object reletive to a frame.
using rotatepoint(quaternion,[1,0,0]) will output where the nose of a plane is pointed

To express a rotation quaternion in a different frame, say instead of frame A, frame B,
use (Q_orientation*Q_AToB)

Q_orientation*[0,1,0,0] takes the point [1,0,0] in the body frame and expresses it in frame A.
Then, the point in frame A must be expressed in frame B. This is done by using Q_AToB.
So, the point is rotated by Q_orientation, then by Q_ATo_B.

Thus, Q_orientation_new = Q_AT_B*Q_orientation
